This front-end project simulates an online shopping experience inspired by **https://fuckthepopulation.com**. It is designed to showcase the user interface without any backend functionality or actual purchasing capabilities.

Built from the ground up, this project utilizes **SCSS**, **HTML**, and **JavaScript** without the use of frameworks to emphasize the core principles of front-end development. It utilizes libraries such as jQuery, FlexSlider 2, and Magnific Popup to enhance interactivity and visual effects.
